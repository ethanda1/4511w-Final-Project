## Environment

### tkinter
This application relies on the `tkinter` module. Supposedly, this comes with most versions of Python3. With mine it did not.

#### Debian based Linux Installation
`sudo apt install python3-tk`


Set up virtual environment with following commands.

1. `python3 -m venv myenv`
2. `source myenv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Jupyter Notebook
Our testing environment was done with Jupyter Notebook. There are nice VsCode extensions for this. Make sure to select `myenv` for your kernel.
